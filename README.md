R - the number of different resource types
C - the number of different consumers
Qr - total of resource type r available to be assigned
L - true for linear problem, false for non-linear
V1(r,c) - value of assigning one unit of resource r to consumer c, linear problem
V2(a,r,c) - value of assigning a units of resource r to consumer c, non-linear problem

#Output

A( r, c ) - quantity of resource type r assigned to consumer type c
V - total value achieved
